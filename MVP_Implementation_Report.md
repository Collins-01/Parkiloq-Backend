---

## 📁 New & Updated Files

- `src/domain/usecases/RegisterUser.ts` — Use case for user registration
- `src/domain/usecases/LoginUser.ts` — Use case for user login
- `src/domain/usecases/UpdateUserProfile.ts` — Use case for updating user profile
- `src/interfaces/controllers/UserController.ts` — Controller for user profile endpoints
- `src/routes/users.ts` — Express routes for user profile (`GET/PUT /profile`)
- `src/middleware/authMiddleware.ts` — Middleware for verifying Supabase JWT and attaching `req.user`
- `src/types/express/index.d.ts` — TypeScript augmentation for `req.user` property

---

## 🛠️ TypeScript & Architecture
- All Supabase SDK usage remains in the infrastructure layer only
- Clean Architecture is strictly followed (use cases, controllers, infra, interfaces)
- TypeScript types extended for Express `Request` to support `req.user`
- Error handling and status codes are standardized in new controllers/middleware

---

## 🧭 Next Steps (Recommended)
- Wire up the new `users.ts` and `auth.ts` routes in your main Express app
- Review and finalize `AuthController.ts` and `routes/auth.ts` for all auth endpoints
- Test all endpoints using Postman or similar tools
- Add request DTOs/validation as needed for production
- Add OpenAPI/Swagger docs for API
